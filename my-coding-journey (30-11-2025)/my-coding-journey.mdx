# The Beginning (6th grade)

I touched my first line of code in **6th grade** when I was experimenting with HTML and CSS during the **COVID-19 lockdown** period.

For me, the curiosity of programming sparked from basic HTML and CSS. Learning how to make a website and style it using CSS was my first introduction to the whole *tech curiosity*.

Fast forward to **8th grade** - schools reopened offline, and I had my first **real** programming touch.

# Experimenting with Py and JS (8th grade)

I really loved the concept of **Python scripts** back in 8th grade. I made some text spamming scripts for WhatsApp and overall desktop. It just felt like ***magic*** to me, because I realized how easy it was to automate tasks like spamming with just Python scripts.

Meanwhile, I also experimented with the **opencv** Python package, which had real-time video analysis, including facial and object recognition.

Finally, at the end of 8th grade, I got introduced to **JavaScript** by CodeWithHarry's JavaScript course. **IT REALLY HELPED ME** - the course was detailed, and I started experimenting with basic JavaScript.

# Diving Deep Into The Fundamentals (10th grade)

By the middle of 10th grade, I got interested in **low-level programming** and electronics, especially **Arduino Uno**.

To learn about low-level programming, I started with **C**. I learned about memory pointers, memory leaks, and many more fundamentals of low-level programming.

After learning C programming, I bought an ***Arduino Uno Starter Kit*** and started experimenting with it. Eventually, I made a project with it and pushed my [**First Repo**](www.github.com/shubh-io/wakey-wakey-alarm) to GitHub.

Eventually, that **spark** for programming hit me again. This time I dove deep into **Python**.

I made my own [Python Application](/work/eyewell) that also has a *Windows MSI installer* in **Jan 2025** and released it **open source (MIT license)** to GitHub.

After my project [Eyewell](/work/eyewell), I shifted to *Full-Stack Development* around the end of grade 10th.

I started with **React Framework** and **Express.js** to learn about full-stack development.

# Current (11th grade)

I started my 11th grade with an introduction to ***Next.js*** Framework. It amazed me how **easy** it was to deploy a web application now with the full application packaged into one server instead of the legacy route of deploying frontend and backend on different servers and connecting both.

After getting used to Next.js, I got to know about **ShadCN UI** component library. This made me realize how **EASY** it is to deploy a website now in comparison to years ago.

Eventually, I came up with a **SaaS** idea based on a programming education platform (quite similar to CodeDex), and obviously, I made a beginner and rookie *mistake* of ***building without ANY validation***.

**I learned a lot from that project, including:**

- **Modern Emotional UI**
- **Redis Caching**
- **Error detection and scalable code by learning TypeScript**
- **Rate limiting**
- **Email collection**
- **NextAuth for custom providers like GitHub and Google**
- **Custom JWT for authentication**
- **Domain purchase and DNS management for Domain routing**
- **MongoDB integration and Schema management**

After that *failed SaaS attempt*, I continued my exploration in programming and made a [Waitlist Template For SaaS](/work/waitlist-for-saas), for quick deployment without **wasting time** starting from scratch.

Now, I am learning about **DevOps, System Design, and Cloud Infrastructure**.

I even made my own ***Home-Server*** with old laptops to practice DevOps and basic system designing. Started off with setting up Linux (used ***Debian Bookworm*** Linux distribution in both), used ***SSH*** to connect both, and used my main laptop as a **Load Balancer**. I used the first old laptop which had *HDD* and older CPU as a ***Storage Node*** and the newer laptop which has *eMMC* and better CPU as a ***Performance Node***. I achieved this using **Docker Swarm** and even hosted **N8N** and my [Waitlist Template](/work/waitlist-for-saas) on an old laptop!

**Things I learned from this project:**

- Learned Linux properly for DevOps
- Load balancing
- Docker
- Docker Swarm
- Next.js app deployment using Docker

Now, coming to the end of the blog, I accept my journey isn't ***"perfect"*** or ***"consistent"***.

It was just **RAW** and driven by **CURIOSITY**, nothing else.
